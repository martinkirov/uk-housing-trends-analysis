# UK Housing Trends Analysis

This repo contains the working files behind the analysis for this medium post: 

### Libraries Used
In the attached Jupyter notebook, I use python3.7 and the following modules: *matplotlib, seaborn, numpy* and *pandas*. 

### Motivation for the project
The attached analysis notebook and the resulting Medium post are part of my submission for Udacity's Data Science for Enterprise nanodegree. Unlike the previous submissions, I had a choice to choose my own subject matter for the analysis and I went with analysing UK Housing Sales data. HM Land Registry and the ONS do a stellar job recording data and maintaining a dataset of sales records going back to 1995. They also make the data available under the Open Government Licence and anyone is free to get the data and explore - please check out the links below.

### Files in Repo
This repo contains only my Jupyter Notebook with the working analysis I did for the blog post. The data itself is too large for me to upload on github (approx. 3.7GB .csv file) and so I've left a direct link below. Furthermore, HM Land Registry update the dataset each month, so if you are reading this after August 2019, do check out the general link below for the most up-to-date dataset. 

### Summary of results
